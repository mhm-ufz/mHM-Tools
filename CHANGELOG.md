# Changelog

## [unpublished]

### Fixed

- Calculate hydrograph KGE/NSE from the cropped overlapping discharge period instead of stale pre-crop arrays.
- Keep hydrograph objective and catchment state per `Hydrograph` instance to avoid stale metrics leaking between runs.
- Apply gridded ESP and SPAEF-like metrics per timestep before averaging, instead of flattening the full time-space array first.
- Handle single-point temporal overlaps in xarray utilities and improve the related crop error logging.
- Fix `create_header()` output handling for explicit file paths, missing parent directories, and existing directories with dots in the name.
- Prevent file output helpers from replacing existing files when the requested output path has no file suffix.
- Handle dotted gauge output directories in catchment creation.
- Use lon/lat box resolution as fallback for L0 resolution in `create-catchment`.
- Added ("longitude", "latitude") to possible xy coordinates in discharge file

### Changed

- Refactor NetCDF writing into `write_xarray_to_netcdf()` and shared helpers in `mhm_tools.common.netcdf`.
- Update install instructions in the README.

### Tests

- Add regression coverage for hydrograph KGE after cropping.
- Add `create_header()` path handling coverage, including CLI `--only-header` output to an explicit file.
- Add and update NetCDF encoding tests for the refactored NetCDF helper functions.
- Update spatial metric tests for corrected ESP/SPAEF output names and timestep-wise behavior.
- Add xarray overlap regression coverage.
